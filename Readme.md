Semiconductor thermal models for PLECS software. These files are important to calculate power losses and junction temperature of the IGBT modules.

The models are organized by voltage class (600V, 1200V, 1700V, 3300V, 4500V and 6500V).

Each module present an IGBT and diode model.

Manufactures: Semikron, Infineon, ABB.
